        "Hamlet" by William Shakespeare is one of the most renowned tragedies in
        English literature. Set in the Kingdom of Denmark, the play follows
        Prince Hamlet as he grapples with grief, betrayal, and the desire for
        revenge following his father's untimely death and his mother's hasty
        remarriage to his uncle, Claudius. Haunted by the ghost of his father,
        who reveals that he was murdered by Claudius, Hamlet becomes consumed by
        doubt and indecision as he seeks to uncover the truth and avenge his
        father's death. Along the way, the play explores themes of madness,
        mortality, and the nature of justice, while also showcasing
        Shakespeare's mastery of language and dramatic tension. "Hamlet"
        continues to captivate audiences with its complex characters, intricate
        plot, and timeless exploration of the human condition.
